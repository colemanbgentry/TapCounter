# Overview

I wanted to create a simple app to try my hand at React Native with the help of the Expo Cli client page and Expo Go app. 

This app is a counting app, allowing the user to increase or decrease a value on screen. With two buttons close to the button of the screen one can increase and decrease the number.I did add a reset button to allow the user to go back to zero if necessary.

I wanted to make a app that allowed me to change a value for a game. 

Here is a link to the video showing the demonstration of the app, then the code.

# Development Environment

I used React Native, through Yarn and Expo. 

React Native is at a basic level JavaScript a HTML format language. Yarn is a package depenency management that can help hold packages for Expo and React. Expo hosted the server that can also interpret React Native.

# Useful Websites

A few Websites that I used for this app to guide and help me are...

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

# Future Work

I struggled a bit to make it work and I had to give up on things that I couldn't figure out yet. So in the future I will like to add these few things.
* To remove the blue buttons and turn the whole screen into a button. Allowing the minus button and plus button to take each half of the screen.
* To have different counting methods, on paper I wanted to figure out a way to make a tally point system for simple board games. At my current skill level, I went with simple numbers. 
* Using dark screens are my favorite, but I know that people do not prefer them, so later will figure out how to get the preset setting for light and dark to affect the app.
